## Introduction

**Readme2Code** is an innovative tool that automates the generation of code from structured README files. By parsing documentation written in Markdown, the tool can produce functional scripts, modules, or other code artifacts, helping developers move quickly from documentation to implementation.

## Installation

To install **Readme2Code**, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Readme2Code.git
cd Readme2Code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use **Readme2Code**, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your README file is structured according to the [Documentation Standards](#documentation-standards).
2. Run the `readme2code` command with your README file as input:

   ```bash
   python readme2code.py README.md
   ```

3. The tool will generate the corresponding code in the specified output directory.
